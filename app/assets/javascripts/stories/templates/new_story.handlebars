      <h3>TELL US YOUR STORY!</h3>
      <p>
        Global Forest Watch is not just about big data; it is a
        movement to connect people on the ground with information that can
        create tangible change. That is why we want to hear <em>your</em>
        stories about issues affecting forests, forest communities, and
        how you use GFW to monitor and protect forests. Share your report
        with the world by putting it on the GFW Map&#33;
      </p>

        layer on the GFW Map. You can submit a story by sharing text and
        uploading images, video, or web links to show how forests are
        being managed, cleared, or protected in your area.

      <h3>TIPS FOR A BETTER STORY</h3>
      <p>In order for your stories to have the most impact, please:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Try to fit your story to:</strong> a) verify data on Global Forest Watch; b) denounce actions affecting forests in your area; or c) promote a success case of forest management.</li>
        <li><strong>Be brief:</strong> The User Stories layer is intended to highlight your story and direct readers to other materials with additional details. Keep your story short and concrete.
        <li><strong>Add media:</strong> Utilize media quotations, technical articles, and publications from well-known sources. We recommend you use high quality videos or pictures to document your case.
        <li><strong>Provide hard facts:</strong> Describe the region of your story using specific details: size, type of forest, forest change, etc.
        <li><strong>Highlight your organization:</strong> Include the name of your organization on the story, as well as your website or contact information.
