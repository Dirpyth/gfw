                    <p>The rankings page features interactive graphs of global tree cover loss and gain and country rankings. The graphs and rankings are based on UMG/Google tree cover data and are organized according to five tabs: loss vs. gain, % loss vs. % gain, extent, loss relative to gain, and loss by climate domain. The graphs and ranks correspond to the selected tab. Drag your mouse over points in each graph to learn more information.</p>
                    <p>Similar to within the country profiles, you can use the “SETTINGS” feature located at the top of the page to adjust the tree cover canopy density of the data presented in the graphs and rankings. Once selected, use the slider at the bottom of the window to adjust the canopy density to one of the following densities: >10%, >15%, >20%, >25%, >30%, >50%, and >75%.  The default tree cover canopy density is >30%. If you select a canopy density other than the default, the “settings” icon will be highlighted green. For more information, click the “?” icon within the “settings” window.</p>

                    <p>Human society and the global economy are inextricably linked to forests. More than 1 billion people depend on forests for their livelihoods. Forest ecosystems also play a critical role in stabilizing the climate; providing food, water, wood products, and vital medicines; and supporting much of the world’s biodiversity.</p>

                    <p>Despite recent efforts to combat harmful deforestation in some regions, forest ecosystems are still under threat. According to <a href='http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/forest-and-landscape-restoration' target='_blank'>WRI research</a>, 30% of potential global forest cover has been cleared, while another 20% has been degraded. Most remaining forests have been fragmented, leaving only about 15% of original forest cover intact.</p>

                    <p>Balancing the demand for natural resources with the need to preserve vital ecosystems requires robust data to help resource managers make good decisions. GFW can help by providing this information at a global scale.</p>

                  <div class='source_summary'>
                    <p><strong>Forest</strong></p>
                    <p>Various definitions exist for the term “forest,” and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus definition. Data sets hosted on GFW may define “forest” differently or pertain to different types of forest (primary, secondary, tree plantations, etc.). Through information found on the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>, we aim to be transparent about the assumptions and definitions feeding into each data set.</p>
                    <p>In our general writing, including the GFW blog, “forest” refers to a landscape with a high density of trees and value for biodiversity, carbon storage, and human use.</p>

                    <p><strong>Deforestation</strong></p>
                    <p>How one defines “deforestation” is dependent on how one defines “forest.” As noted above, various definitions of forest exist and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus view. Correspondingly, GFW does not provide a single definition for “deforestation.”</p>
                    <p>In general writing, GFW uses “deforestation” to refer to the removal of a significant number of trees from a landscape, typically in the context of human actions rather than natural events such as fires or disease. We generally refer to “gross” deforestation (the total amount of forest loss), rather than “net deforestation” (the total amount of forest loss minus the amount of forest gain), or clearly specify otherwise.</p>
                    <p>For more information on each data set, please visit our <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tree cover</strong></p>
                    <p>Where found on the GFW website, “tree cover” refers to the biophysical presence of trees, which may be part of natural forests or tree plantations. The inclusion of all types of tree plantations in the “tree cover” definition notably distinguishes the term from some definitions of “forest.” Accordingly, “tree cover” and “forest” should not be used interchangeably. Different data sets further define “tree cover” with added parameters (see the <%= link_to 'Data page', sources_path %> for details and distinctions).</p>

                    <p><strong>Tree cover loss</strong></p>
                    <p>“Tree cover loss” refers to the removal of trees, which may be within natural forests or tree plantations. Accordingly, “tree cover loss” does not necessarily equate to “deforestation” and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. Different data sets have additional parameters that must be met for the indication or alert of loss to appear on the GFW map (see examples below).</p>

                    <ul class='bullets'>
                      <li><strong>UMD/Google tree cover loss:</strong> Loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal or mortality of tree cover canopy (of any canopy cover density) at the Landsat pixel scale (30x30 meters).</li>

                      <li><strong>FORMA alerts:</strong> Loss alerts are triggered by areas exhibiting a steep, persistent drop in vegetation intensity, indicating a high probability (equal to or greater than 50%) of the occurrence of tree cover loss. It is important to note that this alert-based system is not the same as an area measurement of tree cover loss.</li>

                  <strong class='source_title'>Does GFW distinguish tree plantations from natural forests?</strong>

                </div>
                <div class='source_body'>
                  <div class='source_summary'>
                    <p>Tree plantations are not distinguished from natural forests in the case of several key data sets hosted on GFW (including 2000 tree cover extent, UMD/Google tree cover loss and gain, FORMA alerts, and QUICC alerts). Tree cover loss may include cases of tree plantations being harvested, and tree cover gain may include cases where natural forests are replaced with tree plantations.</p>

                    <p>It is nonetheless important to <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/805.full' target='_blank'>distinguish</a> between natural forests and tree plantations when considering conservation, carbon storage, and value to local communities. Natural forests have higher biodiversity, store more carbon, and are more often associated with the traditional livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Accordingly, GFW and partners are developing a “plantation forests map” for the tropical regions to determine the location of plantations on a near-global scale. The map, developed through remote sensing methods, will be coming soon to GFW.</p>

                    <p>The forest change data displayed on GFW (such as UMD/Google tree cover loss and FORMA alerts) do not necessarily distinguish the quality of the forest management (e.g., sustainable or unsustainable), the legality (illegal or legal), or the cause (e.g., natural or human) of forest change events. For example, the forest change data available on GFW will include forest change from tree harvesting, fires, pests, and forest clearing for agriculture.</p>

                    <p>However, contextual data available on GFW can help users draw more informed conclusions about the nature and drivers of forest change events. For example, users can overlay forest change data over the protected areas layer to flag areas of potential concern. Or users can pull up satellite imagery base maps to look for “burnscars,” “blowdowns,” logging roads, and so on.</p>

In some cases, a lack of available high-quality data may cause a greater margin of error for certain data sets.</p>

                    <ul class='bullets'>
                      <li><p><strong>Intact Forest Landscapes vs. tree cover extent:</strong> These data sets measure different things. Tree cover extent shows all 30 x 30 meter areas that meet a minimum threshold of tree cover (25% canopy cover), whereas Intact Forest Landscapes only show forests that show no significant signs of human activity (see the <%= link_to 'Data page', "#{sources_path}#forest_cover" %> for specifics).</p>

                      <p>Users may find instances where tree cover extent does not fall within the boundaries of intact forest landscapes. This is because the Intact Forest Landscapes layer is based on MODIS (250 meter resolution satellite imagery), which is known to overestimate low tree cover densities, whereas the tree cover extent layer is based on Landsat (30 meter resolution satellite imagery). As a result, the tree cover extent layer may not show tree cover in an area that is covered by an intact forest landscape polygon.</p></li>
