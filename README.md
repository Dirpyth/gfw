# What is Global Forest Watch?

[Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) (GFW) is a
dynamic online forest monitoring and alert system that empowers people
everywhere to better manage forests. This repository contains the GFW web app.

# Developing

The GFW web app rides on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Installing the app

### Docker

Place required environment settings in the `dev.env` file, and then run:

`./gfw.sh develop`

GFW should then be accessible at [localhost:5000/map](http://localhost:5000/map), note, it may take around 2 mins to load due to large number of requests.

### Local setup (>= OS X Yosemite 10.10)

First make sure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) and
[Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
installed.

Next install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the OS X package manager:

```bash
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

We recommend managing your Ruby installation through
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). It's just an easy way to
run multiple Ruby versions for different applications:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
$ brew install imagemagick@6
```

Next clone the gfw repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw.git
```

Using rbenv, install and set Ruby 2.4.0 in the main app directory:

```bash
$ cd gfw
$ rbenv install 2.4.0
$ rbenv local 2.4.0
```

Now let's install Ruby on Rails:

```bash
$ gem install rails
```

Aaaaand now use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), a rubygem manager, to
install all the gem depenencies for the app:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

It is possible if you are using OS Sierra or greater you will experience errors when running `bundle install` and `rmagick`. There is a fix for this forcing symlinks with `imagemagick`. You need to run the following command. Details can be found on [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9050419/cant-install-rmagick-2-13-1-cant-find-magickwand-h).

```bash
$ brew install imagemagick@6 --force && brew link imagemagick@6 --force
```

Installing front end dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Almost there! Final steps are to update your `.env` file:

```bash
RACK_ENV=development
GFW_API_HOST_NEW_API=https://staging-api.globalforestwatch.org/v1
GFW_API_HOST_PROD=https://production-api.globalforestwatch.org/v1
GFW_API_AUTH=https://production-api.globalforestwatch.org

RESOURCE_WATCH_API_URL=https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1
CLIMATE_WATCH_API_URL=https://climate-watch.vizzuality.com/api/v1
FEATURE_ENV=staging
```

Last step. For real. Start the app server and access it at
[http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000):

```bash
$ ./bin/server
```

## Deployment

We follow a [Gitflow Worklow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for development and deployment. Our `master` branch goes to production, `develop` goes to `master`. We also have a staging branch which is detached from the workflow that can be used to merge multiple branches for deployment to the [staging site](http://staging.globalforestwatch.org). Additionally you can deploy `develop` or feature branches to staging if desired.

![gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:b5259cce-6245-49f2-b89b-9871f9ee3fa4/03%20(2).svg)

## Releases

We are using github releases to maintain updates to the app. We recommend using [Zeit Releases](https://github.com/zeit/release) a global npm package for handling github releases and tagging commits. Releases are made from `master` before deploying to production.

## Layers

Map layers, somewhat unsurprisingly, are an important part of GFW. As
such, the config and code supporting them can be a bit complex. Check
out the [layer documentation](docs/layers) for more information. If the
component you're working on isn't in there, please write some
documentation when you're done! ðŸ’ž

## Google Custom Search API

Global Forest Watch uses the Google Custom Search API to power it's site-wide
search.

The search requests are handled inside: `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`
And depend on two config variables that you'll need to setup as ENV vars on
your `.env` file locally or in the Heroku environment settings.

```
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_CX
```

Currently the API being used was generated by `simao.belchior@vizzuality.com`
and the custom search context is owned by Alyssa Barrett on the Google Custom
Search Engine control panel.


## Tests

### Front-end

We have a few Javascript tests in `jstest/` which you can (read: should)
run with Grunt:

```
grunt test
```

### BrowserStack

We use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to find and fix cross-browser issues.
